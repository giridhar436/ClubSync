ClubSync – Centralized Platform for Campus Clubs

ClubSync is a centralized platform designed to make college club activities more accessible, organized, and student-friendly.
In most colleges, students struggle to keep track of multiple clubs, their announcements, upcoming events, and registration links. ClubSync solves this by bringing everything together into one unified place.

With ClubSync, students can easily explore clubs, stay updated on events, and never miss important announcements again.

🚀 Project Description

ClubSync is a web-based platform where students can:

Discover all clubs in the college

View every club’s announcements

Track upcoming events

Access event details like dates, venues, and times

Register for club activities

See all updates in one simple dashboard

Since colleges often have many clubs operating independently, students miss out on opportunities simply because they do not receive the information on time. ClubSync eliminates this gap by offering a single, centralized source of truth for all clubs.

📅 Future Feature: Events Calendar

Although not implemented yet due to time constraints, ClubSync includes a planned feature of a visual events calendar.
This calendar will show event icons on specific dates, allowing students to see:
